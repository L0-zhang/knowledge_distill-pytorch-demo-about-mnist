# mnist-knowledge_distillation-pytorch-demo
Mainly refer to https://github.com/peterliht/knowledge-distillation-pytorch. 
All credit goes to the author of the github.

I just revise it easier and friendlier for the new learner about knowledge_distillation.

For your use,it's noted that you should set up a file folder of the project.

And the path is  "/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/knowledge_distill" in my google colab driver.
